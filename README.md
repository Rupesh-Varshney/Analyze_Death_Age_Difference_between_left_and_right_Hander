# Analyze_Death_Age_Difference_between_left_and_right_Hander

● Handedness, the preference for using one hand over the other for
various tasks, has intrigued researchers for decades due to its potential
implications for brain organisation and cognitive development.

● This study aims to explore the age differences between left-handed and
right-handed individuals, shedding light on potential variations in
cognitive processes and developmental trajectories associated with
handedness.

● Demographic information, hand preference, and age were collected
from participants through surveys and interviews. Statistical analyses,
including correlation analyses, were conducted to assess age
differences between left-handed and right-handed groups.

● Results reveal patterns of age-related differences between the two
groups that right-handed individuals tend to live more as compared to left-hand. Additionally,
the study investigates whether these age differences manifest
consistently across different cultural and socioeconomic contexts.

● Furthermore, the study delves into potential cognitive and neurological
underpinnings that could contribute to the observed age differences. It
considers the existing literature on brain lateralization, cognitive
function, and developmental trajectories in relation to handedness.

● Thisanalysis helps in understanding whether the observed age differences
are influenced by inherent characteristics associated with hand
preference or external factors such as environmental and societal
influences.
